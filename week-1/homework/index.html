<h1>Whale </h1>
<p> Wikipedia tells us this about whales </p>
<blockquote>Whales, derived from Proto-Germanic word hw√¶l,
are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic marine mammals.
They comprise the extant families Cetotheriidae (whose only living member is the pygmy right whale),
Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale),
Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale),
and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).[1][2]
 There are 40 extant species of whales.
The two suborders of whales, Mysticeti and Odontoceti,
are thought to have split around 34 million years ago.[3]
Whales belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla and their closest living relative
is the hippo having diverged about 40 million years ago.[4] </blockquote>

<h2>Whale anatomy </h2>
<p>There are some key parts to the whale anatomy that I think are interesting</p>
<ol>
<li>ears: Whales have torpedo shaped bodies with non-existent external ear flaps,
flat heads, non-flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, and a large tail fin.
Whale skulls have small eye orbits, long snouts (with the exception of Monodontids
and Ziphiidaes) and eyes placed on the sides of its head.</li>
<li>size: Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms
(298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 34 metres (112 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons)
  blue whale. Overall, they tend to dwarf other cetartiodactyls; the blue whale is the largest
creature on earth. Several species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being
larger than the males. One exception is with the sperm whale,which has males larger than the females.</li>
